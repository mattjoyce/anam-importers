"""Reshape a records file's health.blood-pressure rows to Definition v4 (anam card 83).

v4's payload is the Open mHealth blood-pressure-4.0 body with the source's own fields
beside it. Per row:

- systolic, diastolic: the source's text becomes {"value": <number>, "unit": "mmHg"}
  under systolic_blood_pressure and diastolic_blood_pressure.
- date_excel stays (it is the fact time and half the identity) and is also written as
  effective_time_frame.date_time, RFC 3339 with ZONE's offset in force.
- posture "Seated" becomes body_posture "sitting"; any other posture stops the run, since
  mapping one is a decision, not a guess.
- every other field stays exactly as it was.

Ids are untouched, so ingest supersedes each facet in place and keeps its history. The
run is deterministic: the same input writes the same output. Other record types pass
through unchanged. The extracted block gains a reshape note and its version goes up by one.

Usage: bp_diary_omh.py ZONE <records file in> <records file out>

Moved from Anam's scripts/reshape-bp-diary-omh.py (anam card 58); the output is the same.
